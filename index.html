                    Dogs are truly amazing creatures! They are the most popular pets worldwide, evolving from a
                    now-extinct wolf species.
                    These clever canines can learn over <b>100 words</b>, understand human emotions, and have a
                    remarkable sense of smell with up
                    to <b>300 million</b> receptors in their noses, compared to our measly 5 million. They can even see
                    some colors, are either
                    right-pawed or left-pawed, and can breathe through their noses and mouths simultaneously! Some
                    breeds, like the
                    Newfoundland, are even skilled lifeguards. Their keen sense of smell is so powerful, they can even
                    sniff out medical
                    conditions!

                    Dogs are incredibly social creatures, forming strong bonds with their humans and even other dogs.
                    They have a unique
                    ability to understand human emotions and often mirror our moods. They even have a <mark>"best friend"</mark>
                    gene, which helps them
                    form strong social connections. And let's not forget their incredible sense of smell, which they use
                    to navigate their
                    world, communicate with each other, and even sniff out hidden treats!
